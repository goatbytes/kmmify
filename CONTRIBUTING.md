# Contributing to Our Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We're excited to have you join our community. Everyone
is welcome to contribute, whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation.
Here's how you can get started:

### Start with a Fork

Feel free to fork this repository if you want to make substantial changes. This lets you tweak the
project as much as you like in your own version while still allowing you to contribute back to the
main project.

### Making Contributions

1. **Agree to Our Contributor License Agreement (CLA):** Before your contributions can be accepted,
   please sign our [CLA][CLA]. This ensures there are no legal hitches with your submissions.

2. **Make Your Changes:** Work on your forked version of the repository and make your changes. Try
   to keep your updates clear and stick to the project's existing style as much as you can.

3. **Submit a Pull Request:** Once you're ready, send us a pull request. Describe what you've done
   and how it affects the project. We're eager to see your ideas!

### What Happens Next?

We'll review your pull request as soon as we can. We appreciate every contribution, but sometimes
changes might not align perfectly with our project's direction. We'll discuss potential adjustments
with you, so your hard work can still be part of the project.

## Keep Your Fork Updated

Even if your changes don't make it into the project, keep your fork active! Your unique tweaks could
inspire others, and you might find ways to integrate your changes over time.

## Got Questions or Suggestions?

If you have questions or suggestions, please open an issue in the repository. We're always looking
to improve and love hearing from the community.

Thank you for helping us make this project better. We can't wait to see what you bring to the table!
