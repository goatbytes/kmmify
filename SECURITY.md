## Reporting a Vulnerability

Your contributions to the security of our project are greatly appreciated. If you've discovered a
security vulnerability within the project, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. Please
follow these guidelines to communicate the issue responsibly.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please send us an email
at [security@goatbytes.io](mailto:security@goatbytes.io). Provide a clear description of the issue,
including how it can be reproduced, and, if possible, a code snippet or an executable test case
demonstrating the vulnerability.

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report, you should receive an acknowledgment of your report within
48 hours. Following this, the team will:

- Review your report and determine whether the vulnerability can be confirmed.
- Assign a severity level to the vulnerability according to its impact and urgency.
- Notify you of the progress towards a fix and full announcement.
- Work to remediate the issue through mutual agreement, ensuring that a fix is confirmed and an
  update is prepared and deployed.

### Public Disclosure Timing

Please keep your vulnerability report confidential until we have completed the fix and rollout
process. The timeline for public disclosure depends on the severity of the issue and may involve
coordinating with stakeholders and industry partners.

We strive to resolve all security issues in a timely and transparent manner. Collaboration and
communication during the vulnerability disclosure process are vital. We appreciate your help in
keeping our project safe and secure for everyone.
